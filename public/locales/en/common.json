            "My life probably got noteworthy in the year 2000, when I began to work for an agency for internet solutions as an intern, one year later as an apprentice. Three years later, in June 2005, I got my first degree as <strong>Digital Media Designer</strong> (specialized in Online Media). This was just the beginning and so I decided to begin a two-year advanced training at the Chamber of Industry and Commerce as a <strong>Media Engineer</strong> which I successfully completed in August 2008.",
            "While I was completing my training I worked as <strong>Freelance Web Developer</strong> for several agencies as well as for own clients, as Author and Expert for various magazines and as employed <strong>Web Developer</strong> for the raphael GmbH. In May 2008 I founded my first company Mobilistics GmbH, one of the first companies in Germany spezialized in developing and optimizing websites for mobile devices. During that time I also published the first German book about <strong>Mobile Webdesign</strong> at the prestigious German publisher Galileo Computing (now: Rheinwerk).",
            "After a first short trip into the world of entrepreneurship as <strong>Technical Lead</strong> and <strong>CEO</strong> of the Mobilistics GmbH and other very interesting experiences as <strong>Software Developer</strong> at Sevenval, one of the biggest technology providers for mobile solutions in Europe, as <strong>IT Consultant</strong> for itemis AG and as <strong>Co-Founder and CTO</strong> of ubiiqu GmbH I am now working as <strong>Freelance Developer</strong> again. A profession I have always enjoyed and still do."

            "In the past 15 years I was working as Developer there was barely any web technology I had not at least marginally used at some point. I laid the foundation of my professional career doing HTML (optimized for IE5 and Netscape 4.7 at that time), a bit later I also started using CSS (which indeed was not available at the time I began using HTML).",
            "In 1998, at the tender age of 14, I used my pocket money to buy my first book about JavaScript and, well, I'm still using it today! (The language of course, not the book! ;))",
            "Between 2004 and 2008 I had the desire to make some new experiences and broaden my knowledge and so I switchted to mostly doing PHP- and MySQL backend development during that time. With the rise of HTML 5 early 2009 I then switched back to doing frontend development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript almost exclusively.",
            "As time flew by the share of JavaScript in my daily work grew continuously, in 2011 I also started doing some smaller Node.js projects, later I did some more and bigger Node.js projects and in the meantime I have also published some <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/~manuelbieh\">own Node modules on npm</a> and so I'd now consider myself more of a JavaScript Developer than a Frontend Developer (though I still have some decent HTML and CSS skills ;)).",
            "I always try to use the right tool for the problems I have to solve instead of using the same toolset over and over again for each and every project no matter what the requirements are. These circumstances allowed me to grow a broad knowledge about many different technologies in the web sphere and usually I don't need much time to familiarize with unknown technologies or projects.",
            "I must admit, though, that I have recently developed a lot of affection towards React (+ Ecosystem), Webpack and Node.js and so I try to primarily acquire projects where the usage of React would be useful.",
